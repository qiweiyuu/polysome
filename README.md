# Reaction-diffusion model for nucleoid segregation in *Escherichia coli*

This repository contains the code used to simulate a minimal reaction-diffusion model that describes nucleoid segregation in *E. coli*, as described in the paper "Polysome formation drives bulk chromosome segregation and couples it to cell growth in *Escherichia coli*" by Papagiannakis et al. (2024).
